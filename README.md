# Fen's Rice

> Just my own **Gruvbox-flavored Hyprland** setup.
  
> ⚠️ This is not a plug-and-play dotfiles repo — a lot of the paths and scripts are hardcoded to my machine.

## Why

I built this because I wanted:
- a **dark, warm look** that doesn’t strain my eyes,
- tiling workflow with **Hyprland**,  
- some small tweaks and scripts that just make sense for *my* daily use.

It’s messy, but it works for me.

- **Operating System:** Opensuse Tumbleweed
- **Window Manager:** [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)
